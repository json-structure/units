        JSON Structure Symbols, Scientific Units, and Currencies
               draft-vasters-httpapi-json-structure-units

Abstract

   This document specifies "JSON Structure Symbols, Scientific Units,
   and Currencies", an extension to JSON Structure Core.  This
   specification defines a set of annotation keywords for associating
   scientific unit and currency metadata and constraints, primarily for
   use with numeric values.

   JSON Structure Scientific Units provides a mechanism for schema
   authors to explicitly declare the unit associated with numeric data,
   thereby enabling precise mapping between schema representations and
   external data systems.

1.  Introduction

   This document is a companion specification to JSON Structure Core
   [JSTRUCT-CORE].  It defines annotation keywords that allow numeric
   types to be enriched with measurement unit or currency information.

   The primary purpose of this extension is to help numeric values be
   interpreted consistently by specifying their associated scientific
   units or currencies.

   This specification defines the syntax and semantics of the keywords
   that annotate numeric types with scientific unit or currency
   information.  Implementations of JSON Structure Core that support
   this extension MUST process these keywords according to the rules
   defined herein.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Symbol Annotations

   This section defines the keywords used to annotate schema elements
   with symbols that accompany values when presented to users.

3.1.  The symbol Keyword

   The symbol keyword provides a mechanism for annotating a schema
   element with a symbol that annotates the value of the element when
   presented to users.

   The keyword MAY appear alongside the type keyword in object
   properties or array items or map values.

   *  The value of symbol MUST be a JSON string.

   *  The string value of symbol SHOULD contain a Unicode character or a
      multi-character symbol that represents the value of the annotated
      element.

   *  The symbol keyword MAY be used as an annotation on any schema
      element.

   *  symbol MAY be used in conjunction with unit or currency
      annotations or independently.

   Example:

   {
     "type": "number",
     "currency": "EUR",
     "symbol": "€"
   }

   or

   {
     "type": "number",
     "unit": "m/s^2",
     "symbol": "m/s²"
   }

   or

   {
     "type": "number",
     "description": "Number of bunnies",
     "symbol": "bunnies"
   }

3.1.1.  The symbols Keyword

   The symbols keyword provides a mechanism for annotating a schema
   element with a set of symbols that annotate the value of the element
   when presented to users.

   The keyword MAY appear alongside the type keyword in object
   properties or array items or map values.

   *  The value of symbols MUST be a map.

   *  The keys of the symbols map MUST be strings that represent a
      purpose indicator.  The lang: prefix is reserved for language-
      specific symbols.  The suffix after the colon specifies the
      language code.  The language code MUST conform to the [RFC4646]
      standard.

   *  The values of the symbols map MUST be strings that represent the
      symbol.

   *  The symbols keyword MAY be used as an annotation on any schema
      element.

   Example:

   {
     "type": "number",
     "description": "Number of bunnies",
     "symbols": {
       "lang:en": "Bunnies",
       "lang:de": "Kaninchen",
       "lang:fr": "Lapins"
     }
   }

4.  Scientific Unit Annotations

   This section defines the keywords used to annotate numeric types with
   scientific unit information.

4.1.  The unit Keyword

   The unit keyword provides a mechanism for annotating a numeric schema
   (or a schema based on a numeric extended type such as number, int32,
   uint32, int64, uint64, int128, uint128, float, double, or decimal)
   with its measurement unit.

   The keyword MAY appear alongside the type keyword in object
   properties or array items or map values.

   *  The value of unit MUST be a JSON string.

   *  The string value of unit SHOULD contain:

      -  An SI unit symbol or derived unit symbol conforming to the
         Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) International
         System of Units (SI) [IEEE_260.1_2024]

      -  A unit symbol defined in ISO/IEC 80000 series
         [IEC_80000-1_2025]

      -  A non-SI unit symbol defined in NIST Handbook 44 Appendix C
         [NIST_HB_44_2023]

   For "derived" SI units that reflect a multiplication, the unit
   symbols MUST be separated by the asterisk character (*).  For derived
   units that reflect a division, the unit symbols MUST be separated by
   the forward slash (/).  The notation for exponentiation MUST be
   indicated using the caret (^).  For example, acceleration SHALL be
   denoted as "m/s^2".

   Units that use Greek-language symbols (including supplementary or
   derived units) such as Ohm ("Ω") MUST be denoted with those Greek
   symbols (using the corresponding Unicode code points).

   The unit keyword MAY be used as an annotation on any schema element
   whose underlying type is numeric.  Schema processors that support
   JSON Structure Scientific Units MUST use the value of the unit
   keyword to interpret, convert, or display numeric values
   appropriately.

   Example:

   {
     "type": "number",
     "unit": "m/s^2"
   }

4.2.  Unit Annotations

   This is a list of common scientific units that MAY be used with the
   unit.  Units are defined according to ISO/IEC 80000, BIPM SI, and
   NIST HB44:

   *  "ps": Picoseconds

   *  "mΩ": Milliohms

   *  "kΩ": Kilohms

   *  "MW": Megawatts

5.  Currency Annotations

   This section defines the keywords used to annotate numeric types with
   currency information.

5.1.  The currency Keyword

   The currency keyword provides a mechanism for annotating a numeric
   schema (or a schema based on a numeric extended type such as number,
   int32, uint32, int64, uint64, int128, uint128, float, double, or
   decimal) with a currency annotation.

   The keyword MAY appear alongside the type keyword in object
   properties or array items or map values.

   *  The value of currency MUST be a JSON string.

   *  The string value of currency SHOULD contain a three-letter
      currency code conforming to the [ISO_4217_2015] standard.

   *  The currency keyword MAY be used as an annotation on any schema
      element.

   Example:

   {
     "type": "number",
     "currency": "EUR"
   }

6.  Security and Interoperability Considerations

   Alternate unit annotations do not affect the fundamental validation
   of instance data.  They are purely metadata and MUST be ignored by
   validators that do not support this extension.  Applications that
   rely on unit annotations for conversion or display MUST implement
   appropriate validation against recognized standards (BIPM SI and NIST
   HB44) to ensure consistency.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
